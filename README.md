🟢 Task 3-Python Programming Assignment: Data Processing and Analysis

This repository contains solutions to six Python problems involving data processing, analysis, and validation. Tasks include employee bonus eligibility, keyword frequency analysis, sensor data validation, email domain usage, sales spike detection, and duplicate user ID detection. Each problem demonstrates Python concepts like dictionaries, lists, tuples, and string manipulation.


🟢 Task 4 – Python Mini Systems
This task includes six small real-world systems built using Python functions, loops, and conditions.
1. Mobile Recharge Validation – Validates recharge amount and plan with retry option.
2. Inventory Reorder Alert – Checks stock and shows alert if quantity is low.
3. Student Result Processing – Calculates average marks and displays Pass/Fail.
4. Cab Fare Estimator – Calculates fare with peak hour charges and retry option.
5. Attendance Eligibility Checker – Calculates attendance percentage and checks eligibility.
6. Password Strength Checker– Validates password based on length, digit, and special character.
Purpose: To practice Python fundamentals and apply them to real-time scenarios.

🟢Task 6: Function based on problem solving
This program manages event registrations by tracking total users and validating capacity limits.
It prevents overbooking by confirming users only up to the maximum capacity.
Additional registrations are automatically moved to a waitlist.
The system updates registration status as Open or Closed based on availability.

🟢Task 7 – This task contains 6 basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problems implemented using Python classes.
Each program demonstrates real-time use cases like smart lights, employee ID cards, contacts, products, movies, and delivery systems. Concepts used include class, constructor (__init__), object creation, and methods.
These mini projects help in understanding how OOP works in real-world applications.
All programs are simple, beginner-friendly, and practical examples of class-based desi
